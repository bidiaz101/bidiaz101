I am a full stack software engineer with a background in healthcare and biology. Excellent with solving problems, whether they be technical, consumer-related, or 
team-related. I am driven to provide harmony and progress!

One thing I always remind myself of is if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. I not only solve problems, but I take time to create a plan of attack to find the best solution. Ask me about Ruby on Rails, React, or the proper use for each hot sauce brand.
